                         <p>Flowers, as often observed in our day-to-day lives, are the most important elements preferred in aesthetic purposes. They bring in the liveliness and grace with their sweet smell and their attractive appearance. They add a charm and an unknown feel of beauty which canâ€™t be expressed in words but can be felt by heart. Also, their fragrances give a state of calmness to the soul.</p>
